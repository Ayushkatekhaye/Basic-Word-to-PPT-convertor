# Basic-Word-to-PPT-convertor


This Python script utilizes tkinter to create a GUI application for converting Word documents to PowerPoint presentations. It prompts the user to select a Word document, converts its content into slides, and saves the result as a PowerPoint file. The converted slides adopt a predefined slide layout and incorporate a background image. Each slide accommodates text from the Word document, ensuring a maximum of 15 lines per slide. Upon conversion completion, it provides feedback to the user via message boxes.
